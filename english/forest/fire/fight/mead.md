You gather all the materials you'll need to make some mead from the honey you scooped into your waterskin. 
You scour the forest and find everything and begin the mead making process. 
After the first batch is done you put that sweet elixir to your lips and take a swig.
*Gasp* it's... it's... delicious!
You leave a small sample in the forest for others to find, and a legend grows about most delicious mead,
in the whole wide world, that can only be found in this forest.
